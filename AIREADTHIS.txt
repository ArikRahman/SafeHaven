# AI Context for SafeHaven Project

## Project Goal
SafeHaven is a hardware-software integration project that detects people using a camera and performs a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) scan over the detected area using a gantry system.

## Critical Instructions for AI
1.  **Paths**: ALWAYS use absolute paths or be very careful with relative paths. The project structure is nested.
2.  **Comments**: Comment EVERY piece of code you write to avoid cyclical backtracking and ensure clarity.
3.  **Documentation**: When creating new modules, create documentation and indexes for them.

## Key Files & Directories
-   `/SoftwareDemo/main.py`: The MASTER entry point. It orchestrates the camera, path generation, and motor control.
-   `/SoftwareDemo/GantryFunctionality/`: Contains `MotorTest` (motor control), `LimitSwitches`, and `ShutoffSwitch`.
-   `/SoftwareDemo/PiCamera/`: Handles image capture and YOLO detection.
-   `/SoftwareDemo/SnakepathAlgorithm/`: Generates the scanning path (`pathlist`) for the motors.
-   `/Arduino/`: C++ code for the Arduino motor controller.
-   `/MATLAB/`: Post-processing scripts for SAR data.

## Hardware Context
-   **Controller**: Raspberry Pi (running the Python code).
-   **Motor Driver**: Arduino (receiving commands from Pi).
-   **Sensors**: Pi Camera, mmWave Radar (implied for SAR), Limit Switches, E-Stop.

## Development Status
-   `SoftwareDemo` is the active integration folder.
-   `Obsolete` folders contain deprecated code.
-   `BoundaryBoxDetect` and `SnakePathAlgorithm` (root folders) are likely for standalone testing/development before integration into `SoftwareDemo`.
