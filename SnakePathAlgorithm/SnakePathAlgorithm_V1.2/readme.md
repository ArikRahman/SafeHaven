# Snake Path Algorithm V1.2 Changelog:
    # Fixed y output values showing as np.float(y) and now appears as float values with 4 decimal places

# Notes
    # Identified problem that if x range is not long enough the path generated will end at the bottom. This problem could be neglected it could just return straight to origin
    # Identified slant problem with points
    # Implement interrupt function
    # Implement method to move scanner to start position and return to origin from destination

# How to use it
